# Kaching

Ever wondered how much money you make while on a bathroom break?  Why do work when you could instead just watch your pay slowly trickle in? How many seconds of your life are worth a dollar?

These are a few of the increasingly depressing questions you could have answered with Kaching! Just build and run the script in your terminal and enter your yearly salary. Then Kaching will show you how much cummulative cash you've earned since running the executable! Kaching updates the cummulative cash amount every second by adding your "per-second salary" (yearly salary / 12 months / 20 days / 8 hours / 60 minutes / 60 seconds).

In case it isn't obvious, I do recognize that this is an incredibly sad and toxic window through which to view your existence. But what the hey.


## Running Kaching

Simply do `. ./build.sh` in the Kaching directory.
